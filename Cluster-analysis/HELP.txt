Generation:
	GEN_CLOUD m_x m_y d_x d_y n -- generates cloud consisting of n points centered
		at point (m_x m_y) with variance (d_x, d_y)
	GET k -- copies cloud number k to the buffer.
	SET k -- copies the buffer cloud into the field as k-th cloud.
	ROTATE deg -- rotates the buffer cloud at an angle of deg.
	SHIFT x y -- shifts the buffer cloud by vector (x,y)
Algorithms:
	MATRIX -- creates the distance matrix and change gen mode to false.
	BINARY delta -- creates the binary matrix using threshold distance delta.
	DBBINARY delta deg -- creates the dbbinary matrix using theshold distance delta
		and number of neighbor points deg.
	WAVE -- starts the wave algorithm.
	DBSCAN -- starts the dbscan algorithm.
	SPANING_TREE -- starts the spaining tree algorithm and creates the edge 
		distribution histogram.
	KMEANS k -- starts the k-means algorithm to find k clusters.
	KER_KMEANS k m -- starts the k-means algorithm to find k clusters with m kernal 
		points.
	EM k -- starts the em algorithm to find k clusters.
	HIER -- starts the hierarchical algorithm.
	FOREL r c -- starts the FORmal ELements algorithm with a radius of circles 
		equal to r and increase	coefficient of cirles equal to c.

	TRIANGULATE -- builds the Delonay triangulation of the field.
	INTERPOLATE x y -- interpolates the value of the function 
		y = (x^2 + y^2) / 5 + 1 at point (x , y).
Saving results:
